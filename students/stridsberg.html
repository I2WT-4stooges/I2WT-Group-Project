                <p>Let us start with a brief introduction:<br>
                    I was born in 1988 the 20th of July, 13.20, just in time for supper according to my mom! I am the oldest of total 8 siblings, 2 which are from the same parents and 5 bonuses. I Love having a big family and could not be happies that my parents finally found their perfect matches.</p>




                <h2>School years</h2>

                <p>For my lower secondary school years, I choose a school that once a year would organize a cabaret where the students had to create everything. From scripts, light, sound, dance routines, props and sometimes even their own music. It was a lot of fun and helped create many wonderful bonds between students.</p>
                <p>Moving on to upper secondary school I started the business economics program but soon after I realized I would not be happy studying neither this program nor in this town or school and changed to a different school to continue studying the Aesthetic Music Program. I graduated in 2007 still didn’t know what I wanted to study further so i started working immediately instead. 
                    It took me many years and breaking my back twice before I could finally decide on what to study.</p>

                <p>There was a lot of logic going into what I wanted to choose and how I wanted to live my future post graduate life.
                    My future job needed to enable me to, work from wherever I am located, no heavy lifting and I needed to be able to make myself understood, both to colleagues and clients in whatever country I would be in, thus the work needed to have English as the main language. My future husband and the father of my son suggested his own field, computer science.</p>

                <p>I have always been curious about things I do not understand, and Computer Science is something I not yet understand, so why not learn? I eventually started at Thessaloniki’s’ City College program of Computer Science. It is hard to learn something completely new but also so much fun! I love learning to code and figure out new possibilities and solutions to problems I did not even know existed. And to learn the build and history of computers is a blast! All in all, I love it and it is a completely different feeling to work with people who actually takes responsibility for their studies and like what they are doing!</p>

                <h3>Besides, studying computer science, playing, and creating my own music I also love:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tv, films, series and especially Anime.</li> 
                    I am using a multiple of different tools for this like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/se-en/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/sv-se/">Disney plus</a> and <a href="https://www.chia-anime.me/">Chia-anime</a>.

                    <li>Puzzles and games;</li> I play mostly on our Nintendo switch, since none of my family and friends here in Greece are particularly interested in boardgames or puzzles. I do have to keep it family friendly since my son is watching, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_RauOChNU">Donkey Kong </a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LbHBMtHUw0">Super mario</a> is the go to games when he is around. And sometimes I play nostalgic games on the PC like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCCJxqTzpiA">day of the tentacle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxDDAjKMfs">svearike</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SZlJfg7LmE">dungeon keeper 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm2kTfwT9HU">Black & White</a> etc. One game I'm really looking forward to play is the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2yHPZtdtck">Fable</a> that was relased in 2020.  

                    <li>Animals, from the creepy crawlers to giants of the earth;</li> 
                    Both to visit in <a href="https://www.swedentips.se/zoos/">zoos</a> and go on safari trips, or from home by watching National geographics nature programs and other documentaries on tv or online <a href="https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/">HERE</a>.

                    <li>Books, both reading, listening and sometimes writing.</li> 
                    Nowadays I don’t have the time to read books so most reading is night stories for my son or listening to audio books on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=grit.storytel.app&hl=en_US&gl=US"> Storytel</a>a> while walking or doing house chores. 

                    <li>Hiking, Nature and camping;</li>
                    we used to go hiking almost every weekend until corona hit us, we would go right outside Thessaloniki <a href="http://framewalk.blogspot.com/2015/12/blog-post_4.html">Kissos Oros</a> or up to <a href="https://travelpassionate.com/things-to-do-in-zagorohoria-epirus-greece/">Zagorohoria</a> or <a href="https://www.mountolympus.gr/en/trails.php#.X_vLL9gvOiM">Olympus</a> to hike around and explore i haven't made it to the top yet but who knows what the future will bring. Every summer for the past 6 years we would also go camping, either free camping or in an organized one, last year we had to go for a couple of organised ones but this summer I hope we will be able to visit <a href="https://www.itinari.com/your-secret-greek-island-hippie-samothraki-tndi">Samothraki Island</a> for the 5th time. 

                    <li>Travel;</li> 
                    If I could afford, I would go to all the corners of the world! Some of my bucket list destinations are, <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/">Japan</a> (again), I've been to Tokyo but would love to back pack around this wonderful country. <a href="https://www.australia.com/en/things-to-do/adventure-and-sports/must-do-activities-in-australia.html">Australia</a>, <a href="https://travelaway.me/hobbiton-the-real-hobbit-village/">New Zeeland</a> Not only to visit Hobbiton but also to try out the multitude of adrenaline activities it offers, and many many more places!
                </ul>

                <p>But I would not be able to enjoy any of the above without the one that trumps all.
                    My family and friends, nothing makes me happier, than being with my loved ones. I am currently enjoying my greatest adventure yet, exploring the world with my partner and our son, watching him grow and evolve. All the while studying at City College trying to become a good role model and empowering myself with the confidence of learning a great and stimulating job.</p>

                <h3>One of our Introduction to webtechnology tasks were to create a website, my field of responsibility was history of tattoos. And below are most of the HTML and CSS code I used:</h3>

                <p>But before we go into that I would like to show how an empty HTML document looks like and explain what a tag is.</p> 
                <h4>This is the start of your webpage</h4>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
                &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;  Title Name &lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;style&gt; All CSS code in here &lt;/style&gt;  
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;

                <p>here is where the content goes.</p>

                &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;
                So what is a tag? a tag is anything between &lt;&gt; including the &lt;&gt; and for the closing one you add a / like this: &lt;/&gt;. There are also empty tags like the &lt;br&gt; which doesn’t have an a closing tag. Depending what kind of letters you put inside the &lt;&gt; to make it a tag will also define if it is a block or an inline tag. Headings for example are <b> block</b> which will not allow anything else to be on the same line as itself and <b>inline</b> can be used inside of ex. text  like I just did with the &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; to make my text bold.
                <h4> Css <h4>
                    <p>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheet, which I will describe a bit further down. What is important to know is where you write your code and how since it has a rule of importance.  </p>
                    <h4>importance less to most</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>external stylesheet is in its separate folder ex. Stylesheet.css
                        <li> internal stylesheet: is written on the page inside the head tag inside the styles open and closing tag. This will overrule anything you might have put in an external stylesheet.
                        <li> inline style: any tags you might have in the body can also contain its own style inside the opening tag. Ex. &lt;h3 style =” put style commands here”&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;. This overrules anything put in both external and internal style sheets.
                    </ul>


                    &lt; html &gt; &lt; /html &gt; 
                    <p>The beginning and end of your web page </p>
                    
                    <h4>&lt; head &gt; &lt; /head&gt;</h4> 
                    <p>The head tag is where the style with css commands, title and imported code address is located.</p>
                    <h4>&lt;titel &gt; > &lt; /title&gt;</h4>
                    <p>what ever you write between the closing and opening titles tag will be displayed on the browser tab</p>
                    <h4> &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; <h4>
                        <p>Located in the head tag. This is where I put most CSS code. The CSS is defined by commands if it should include all similar tags or the more specific way by a class or id name. to specify if it’s a class you put a punctuation in front of the name and if an id you put a hashtag #.</p>
                        <p>e.g.<br> 
                            .classname {<br>
                            And in here you put the CSS commands <br>
                            }<br>
                            #idname {<br>
                            And in here you put the CSS commands<br>
                            }<br>
                            Or just tags like ‘p’ or ‘a’ which will be discussed further down.<br>
                            E.g.<br>
                            p {<br>
                            CSS commands for all the paragraphs <br>
                            }</p>
                        <h4>Lists: <h4>
                            <p>There are three different lists that I am aware of <br>
                                Unordered list: which is bullet points. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 
                            <ul>
                                <li>first
                                <li>second
                                <li>third
                            </ul>
                            Ordered list: numbered list
                            <ol>
                                <li>first
                                <li>second
                                <li>third
                            </ol>
                            Nested list: a list inside a list
                            <ul>
                                <li>first 
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>first
                                        <li>second
                                        <li>third
                                    </ol>
                                <li>second
                                <li>third
                            </ul>
                            <p> To define which each element of the list is you put a &lt;li&gt; &lt; /li &gt; 
                                tag, by accident I found out that the closing tag is optional, but will help organize your code and make it look neater especially if you have a nested list.</p>
                            <h4>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</h4> 
                            <p></p>
                            <h4>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</h4> 
                            <p></p>
                            <h4>&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;</h4>
                            <p> The em tag is an inline tag that you can use to emphasise your words like this: <em> emphasise </em></p>
                            <h4>&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;</h4>
                            <p>The b tag is an inline tag that will make the words in your text bold like this <b>Bold</b> </p>
                            <h4>&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</h4>
                            <p>The <b>a </b>command is defined as a hyperlink and used to link different pages together. By using the <b> href </b> attribute and the URL of the page you want the user to visit when activating. <br>
                                &lt;a href = “http://www.URL.adress” &gt; Click here &lt;/a&gt; <br>
                                You can style your links as well by adding attributes in the CSS code’ up in the style tag.</p>
                            <h5>Ex:<h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> a: hover = when the users mouse is hovering above the link, you can add colour, back-ground colour and more.
                                    <li>a:active =  when the user is pressing down on the link
                                    <li>a:focus = when the user uses the keyboard to move between links if you put a different colour then the user will know which link he/she is on in the page.
                                    <li>a:visited= when the user have clicked the link once it changes colour or what ever else you would like it to do.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>    

                                <h4>&lt;img&gt;</h4>
                                <p>The image tag is an inline tag which means that you can use it inside other commands or text. E.g.</p> 
                                &lt;img src=”/img/html/dogwalkpic.jpg” alt = “picture of a man walking his dog”&gt; 
                                <p>it does not have a closing tag. The src attribute I put inside the img tag is to call the picture to the page with its URL. The alt attribute is for people who are blind or for pages that might not be able to show the picture, if that’s the case then this text will appear instead. </p>
                                <h4>&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</h4>
                                <p>P for paragraph, when you have a text to show on the website this tag helps to show the different paragraphs and the </p> will ensure a break between the different paragraphs. 
                                <h4> &lt;h1-6&gt; &lt;/h1-6&gt; <h4>
                                    <p>H for heading. There are a number of different headings where 1 is largest and 6 smallest. This tag is  </p>
                                    <h4>&lt;br&gt; </h4>
                                    <p>The line breaker. Will push all text after it to the next line. </p>
                                    <h4>&lt;article&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</h4>
                                    <p> the article tag is used for news stories and blogs etc. I used it for one of my smaller texts which worked well. </p>
                                    <h4>&lt;table&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</h4>
                                    <p> A table is a way of showing data in rows and columns </p> 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Th = table heading, will make everything you write inside bold.
                                        <li>Tr = table row withing table 
                                        <li>Td = table data within table row 
                                        <li>table border = line around the table.
                                        <li>Col = columns 
                                        <li>Row = row span
